# 🧹 sweepi

Sweepi is a personal project for enforcing LLM guardrails through linting.

The goal is to keep AI-assisted code generation aligned with a specific set of architectural and API design constraints, without forcing those dependencies into every target repository or their maintainers.

```sh
npx sweepi
```

## Install

For repeated audits, a global install is faster than `npx`.

```bash
npm install --global sweepi
```

## Quick start

Initialize Sweepi once to create `~/.sweepi`:

```bash
sweepi init
```

Then, ask your LLM to "lint your changes", or run the CLI directly with a project path:

```bash
sweepi ./path/to/project
```

Initialization installs the Sweepi LLM skill with `npx skills add jjenzz/sweepi`.

## Guarantees

- does not modify the target project's `package.json`
- does not modify the target project's lockfile
- keeps lint dependencies isolated to `~/.sweepi`

## Packages

- `packages/eslint-plugin-sweepit` - The rule engine. This package contains Sweepit's opinionated ESLint rules and shared flat configs (`core`, `react`) used to enforce guardrails.
- `packages/sweepi` - The execution wrapper. This CLI bootstraps an isolated toolchain in `~/.sweepi` and runs ESLint against a target project without changing that project's dependency graph.
